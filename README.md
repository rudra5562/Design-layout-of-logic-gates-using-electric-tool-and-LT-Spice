# Design-layout-of-logic-gates-using-electric-tool-and-LT-Spice
Overview This project involves the design, layout, and simulation of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR) using the Electric VLSI Design System and LT-Spice. The goal is to create optimized, low-power, and high-performance digital circuits by carefully designing the transistor-level schematics and layouts.
